**Phase 1 Requirements:** 

“Create a standalone program to model the creation of quiz questions and answers. Questions must not be hard-coded in any way, shape, or form. You are strongly encouraged to use XML or JSON to model the questions and answers. You’ll build a simple program to parse the questions and render them one at a time for a user response. For Phase 1, questions may be true/false, multiple choice, fill in the blank(s), matching (e.g. items on the left to items on the right), etc. You may write your code in any language.”
