# Distributed-Systems
Creating a standalone program to model the creation of quiz questions and the tracking of answers from multiple users. Questions are modeled in XML format for persistent storage. The Flask framework is used to manage communications between the front and back ends of our project.

# Development Server Operation
To deploy the quiz responses server, run the following command from the `app` directory:
```bash
env FLASK_APP=server.py flask run
```
